# Note that if you're using Ember, you won't use these
# forms of partials. Rather, you'll declare Emberized
# partials as templates with a leading underscore
# in the filename and render them with
# the `partial` helper.

# This is the easiest way use precompiled partials:
# precompile them as templates and just copy them over.
# For a strictly vanilla HB setup w/ precompilation, you'll
# copy over from `Handelbars.templates`.
Handlebars.partials = Ember.TEMPLATES
